=head1 NAME

EVP_SIGNATURE-HMAC, EVP_SIGNATURE-SIPHASH, EVP_SIGNATURE-POLY1305,
EVP_SIGNATURE-CMAC
- The legacy B<EVP_PKEY> MAC signature implementations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The algorithms described here have legacy support for creating MACs using
L<EVP_DigestSignInit(3)> and related functions. This is not the preferred way of
creating MACs. Instead you should use the newer L<EVP_MAC_init(3)> functions.
This mechanism is provided for backwards compatibility with older versions of
OpenSSL. 

There are no parameters supported by the legacy EVP_PKEY MAC signature
algorithms. See L<EVP_PKEY-HMAC(7)>, L<EVP_PKEY-SIPHASH(7)>,
L<EVP_PKEY-POLY1305(7)> or L<EVP_PKEY-CMAC(7)> for details about parameters that
are supported during the creation of an EVP_PKEY.
